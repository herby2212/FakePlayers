## General
FakePlayers is a Spigot plugin which creates fake players on your server including a name and tablist slot (**advanced mode**).

This effects the server list of a player when hovering over the connection he will see the names of the players like real ones.

The amount and names of online players to be faked can be set in the config and adapts when a player joins/leaves to simulate a normal behaviour.

The plugin can also be used in a **simple mode** were only the online player count of the server in the serverlist is faked.
